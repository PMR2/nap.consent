# nap.consent

Hi! This is the source code of plone **add-on** specifically for PMR website. The aim of this add-on is to **manage survey** to collect **Physiome Model Repository (PMR)**'s user perception and behaviour when searching for information into PMR.  For this purpose **nap.consent** composted of three parts:
 - Consent
 - Feedback collection
 - Data presentation
Further, we will describe the installation process, set up the survey, and survey specification.

## Installation process
These are steps to install on PMR:
 - Edit **buildout.cfg**, add this code inside the file
  ```
    develop = ${testing:develop}
        ...
        src/nap.consent

    ...
    ...

    eggs=
        ...
        nap.consent
  ```
 - Edit **deploy-all.cfg**, add this code inside the file
  ```
      develop =
        ...
        src/nap.consent
  ```
 - Run this code sequentially:
  ```
    # /etc/init.d/pmr2.zeoserver stop
    # /etc/init.d/pmr2.instance stop
    # bin/buildout
    # bin/buildout -c deploy-all.cfg
    # /etc/init.d/pmr2.zeoserver start
    # /etc/init.d/pmr2.instance start
  ```

## Set up the survey
 - Log in as admin, then access Site Setup page
 - Select the add-ons page
