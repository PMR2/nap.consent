<p><strong><br />PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Title: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Smart Searching for the Physiome Project</p>
<p><strong>Investigators: </strong>Yuda Munarko (Ph.D. candidate), Dr. David Nickerson (Primary Investigator), Dr. Koray Atalag (Co-Investigator)</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide an effective and user-friendly search engine feature on the Physiome Model Repository (PMR) website. Currently, the PMR consists of more than 800 models and is constantly growing. However, users often have difficulty in finding needed models. While most of us are familiar with general search engines such as Google and Bing, creating a simple query in the PMR search feature can be tricky. We suppose that the cause is the nature of the models that affect to nonoptimal available technologies implementation. </p>
<p>At present, we have enriched the knowledgebase inside the PMR by developing and implementing technologies for model visualisation, model analytical, and models interconnection and communication. This knowledgebase can then be utilised to interpret user needs so that relevant models can be found. We expect that the proposed PMR search engine feature will have a simple interface, Google like interface, so it is not changing users&rsquo; habit.</p>
<p>Yuda Munarko is a Ph.D. candidate from the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, the University of Auckland. This project is the research topic of his study.</p>
<p><strong>The Collected Data</strong></p>
<p>The project will collect explicit feedback and implicit feedback from participants.</p>
<p>Explicit feedback will be provided by participants by answering a short question related to the accessed webpage. This feedback is indicating precise participantsâ€™ satisfaction level, page relevancy level, and their suggestion for the system. The collection process will use an online questionnaire conducted during your activity in the PMR website.</p>
<p>Implicit feedback is indirect feedback containing information about participants&rsquo; activity when looking for information on the PMR website. This feedback will be automatically stored on the server without participants&rsquo; action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this feedback will be used complementary in order to measure the performance of the existing system, to understand users behaviour in seeing information, and to improve the performance of the existing system.</p>
<p>Technically, the feedback collection process will utilise cookie and query log technologies. We do our best to not distract your activity, therefore, a question will be presented one or two times at a particular web page as a small popup footer.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Recruitment</strong></p>
<p>The participants are the registered and unregistered users of the PMR website (this website). By clicking the &lsquo;Accept&lsquo; button on the informed consent form, you are listed as a participant in this project. If you are a registered user, it is recommended to log in before continue your activities. If you are an unregistered user, you can immediately start your activities.</p>
<p>You may then access the website as usual and contribute to the project by answering a short question (multiple-choice or text-based questions) in a selected page.</p>
<p><strong>The Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are designed to maintain the data collection process. Specifically, cookies are used to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain your informed consent form.</li>
<li>Track your activity in a web browser application when accessing the PMR website.</li>
<li>Select a question based on your participation state.</li>
<li>Store your user session.</li>
<li>Ensure the anonymity of you contribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Removing cookies will stop your contribution, but not the already recorded data. To do so, you should follow the &ldquo;withdraw from survey&rdquo; link.</p>
<p><strong>Risk and Benefit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no direct risk associated with your participation in this project as your personal identity will not be saved.</li>
<li>While you will not receive immediate benefits when contributing to this project, this will ultimately be of benefit to future users of the PMR website.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Condition of Participation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any material or information uploaded must be anonymised and must not identify the subject from whom it was collected.</li>
<li>The contribution to this project is voluntarily, neither the investigators nor the University of Auckland is able to provide reward to the participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Right as a Participant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although you agree to contribute to this project, it is your right to give feedback or not. You may ignore the question if you do not want to answer or the question is not relevant.</li>
<li>You may withdraw your contribution by accessing the &ldquo;withdraw from survey&rdquo; link. However, it will remove your explicit feedback collected from the most recent consent. Your implicit feedback is not retractable, it remains in the server as anonymous data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anonymity and Confidentiality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The data stored will be anonymous, no names, e-mail addresses, or IPs for all participants.</li>
<li>For the registered PMR website participants, the information used is only the registration status and login status.</li>
<li>If the information you provided is reported/published, this will be presented as an analysis result along with all data collection so its source cannot be identified.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data storage/use/destruction</strong></p>
<p>Your informed consent form will be stored at your device as cookies and at server at the University of Auckland. The informed consent form will be renewed yearly for the duration of the project and will be maintained in the server for a period of six years, after which it will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The project itself will last at least 3 years. The data collected will be stored on the hosting infrastructure under the control of the University of Auckland and will be retained for at least this period. The data will be collected for at least the period covered by the project&rsquo;s current ethics approval, after which an extension may be applied for.</p>
<p>The collected data will be anonymous and will be publicly available for view and download after pre-processing. The investigators assume that the main users of the data are researchers who are interested in developing tools, technologies, and search engine in Bioengineering, however, the use of data by other group such as researchers in domain specific search engine and user experience is also possible. Furthermore, the data may be post-processed by splitting, filtering, classifying, and other processes by users who download it.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that the collected data will be useful for future analysis and investigation. Therefore the data will be stored for up to 6 years after the study period so that it can be used for research purposes that have not been defined.</p>
